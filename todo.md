- Dashboard
  - Add functionality to update form

- Error Handling
  - Check all endpoints error handing - client side
  
- Flash Messaging  
  - Ensure on all routes

Future Features
- Notifications
- Message a Connection

Revisit 
- Refactor Connect/Dashboard re-render after getPendingRequest update

Possible Refactor
- The list for rendering: connection, pendingConnection and connect users is the same except the buttons
- perhaps I will refactor this as a function to return JSX and map over any buttons passed in.
